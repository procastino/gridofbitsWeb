This is an attempt to replicate Grid of Bits (https://github.com/franzks/gridofbits), a game that I use a lot with my CS students when we are learning about binary system. It would be useful for me to have a sort of replica playable on a computer, so here it (hopefully one day) will be.
I'm not programmer, I'm learning about JS as it goes, so get ready to read awful code and plenty of bad practises!
